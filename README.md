**Project: Basic recipe website in HTML**
This project is a practical exercise to apply my knowledge of HTML within the framework of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) course.

## Description
This website is a collection of simple recipes, organized around a homepage (`index.html`) which contains links to several recipe pages. Each recipe page details the ingredients, preparation steps, and may include images or tips.

### Learning objectives
Through this project, I demonstrate my ability to:

- Structuring a web page with semantic HTML tags ( `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
- Create links between pages ( `<a>`).
- Organize content with lists ( `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`).
- Integrate images ( `<img>`) and titles ( `<h1>`to `<h6>`).
- Use paragraphs ( `<p>`) and HTML comments.
- Apply a clear hierarchy and simple navigation.
