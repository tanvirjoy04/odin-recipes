        <li>Add 3 sliced white onions and fry for about 5 minutes until they turn translucent.</li>
        <li>Place the lamb shanks into the pot. Season with 1 tablespoon of salt and 2 tablespoons of cumin powder.</li>
        <li>Sear the meat with the spices for around 10 minutes until a nice sear develops and an aromatic fragrance arises.</li>

        <li>Remove any excess fat or impurities that rise to the top.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a lid and let it cook on medium heat for about 2 hours until the meat becomes tender and easily falls off the bone.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, heat half of the remaining ghee.</li>

        <li>Increase the heat and allow the rice to surface. Gently stir to evenly distribute the rice in the pot.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of cumin powder over the rice.</li>
        <li>Add the previously prepared fried carrots and raisins to the pot, ensuring even distribution.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with foil and then with a lid to create a tight seal.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and let it cook for 30 minutes until the rice is fully cooked and each grain remains distinct.</li>
