    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ilish or Hilsa is the king of king among all fish! It is a very popular and sought-after fish in the Indian Subcontinent, and is the national fish of Bangladesh and the state fish of West Bengal. The most famous hilsha fish comes from Chandpur, Bangladesh. This fish alone contributes about 12% of the total fish production and about 1.15% of GDP in Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>It can be eaten in many different ways — fried, steamed, mashed, salted, smoked, fermented, baked in young plantain leaves, prepared with mustard seed paste, curd, eggplant, and many different vegetables and condiments, cooked in rice pilaf. I once read a book that showcased preparing Ilish in 200 different ways. To say, Bengalis love this fish is an understatement.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ilish Steaks — 6 pieces</li>
        <li>Turmeric — 1/2 tbsp</li>
        <li>Red Chili Powder — 1 tbsp</li>
        <li>Salt — 2 tsp or as needed</li>
        <li>Mustard Oil — 1/4 cup</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil — 2 tbsp</li>
        <li>Onions - 1 large, sliced thin</li>
        <li>Fresh Green Chilies - 8-10</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat dry the ilish steaks with paper towel to remove any excess moisture.</li>
        <li>Coat the fish pieces wth turmeric, red chili powder and salt.</li>
        <li>In a skillet, heat mustard oil and vegetable oil over medium-high heat until it starts to smoke. Note: I like to mix the two oils when frying but traditionally you are to fry it in mustard oil only.</li>
        <li>Add the fish pieces carefully and fry on each side until it is crispy and golden-brown. Once the fish is fried to your preference, remove it from the heat and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onions and green chilies to the leftover oil with rendered fish fat. Fry them until the onions are translucent and changes to a yellow color and the chilies start to blister on the side.</li>
        <li>Garnish the fish with the crisp fried onion and green chilies, then pour the hot oil with rendered fat on top.</li>
        <li>Serve the ilish bhaja with gorom bhat (hot steamed rice) or panta bhat (fermented steeped rice).</li>
    </ol>
