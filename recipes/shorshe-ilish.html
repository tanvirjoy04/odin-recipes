    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ilish, or Hilsa Fish is the national fish of Bangladesh and the state fish of West Bengal, India. This fish contributes to about 12% of the total fish production and about 1.15% of GDP in Bangladesh. Also known as Hilsa Herring or Hilsa Shad, this is a species of fish related to the herring. It's rich in omega 3 fatty acids which gives the fish its' marbled fat content and softness. </p>
    <p>Shorshe Ilish is a classic Bangladeshi recipe made with mustard paste, green chillies and mustard oil. The dish that makes a Bengali, I personally think. Ilish, or anglicized as Hilsa is a fish that holds a very special place in every Bengali’s heart. There is no other fish in the world that even comes close to it’s taste, flavor or aroma. </p>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To make hilsa in mustard, first of all, you have to take 700 grams of hilsa fish. 700 grams has
been cut into 6 pieces. In it, you have to add 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of turmeric
powder. So that the fish can be easily coated, you have to add 1 teaspoon of mustard oil. Then,
the fish should be coated well with salt, turmeric and oil.</li>
        
        <li>To make Shorshe Ilish Recipe, you should use large mustard seeds. Do not use the small
mustard seeds available in the market, otherwise the Shorshe Ilish Recipe will be bitter. For
700 grams of fish, we will need 5 teaspoons of black mustard seeds, 2 teaspoons of poppy
seeds, 2 teaspoons of white mustard seeds, 5-6 raw chilies, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of
mustard oil. Then mix all the spices well with the required amount of water. Then grind this
spice well and make a paste. Keep in mind that if the amount of water is too much, the spice
will not be a good paste. And if you grind the spice in a mortar, it will be even better.</li>
        
        <li>Do not add the mustard paste directly to the gravy. First, add a little water to this paste. Then
strain it well so that the mustard seeds separate and a smooth paste is obtained. Make sure
that the paste is not too thick and not too thin.</li>

        <li>Then take 50 ml of mustard oil in a pan . Add 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder to this oil.
While adding turmeric, make sure to reduce the flame of the gas otherwise there is a possibility
of the turmeric burning. When the raw smell of turmeric is gone, add the mustard paste
prepared earlier. Then mix everything well. The color of the shorshe ilish (Shorshe Ilish Recipe)
becomes better due to adding turmeric to the oil.</li>

        <li>Then when the gravy starts boiling, add the previously marinated fish. After adding the fish to
the gravy, spread a little gravy on the fish with the side of the spoon. So that the entire fish is
covered with mustard paste. Then cook it with the lid on for exactly 5 minutes. Then open the
lid, turn the fish over and cook the other side with the lid on for 5 minutes. At this time, the
flame on the gas must be reduced. Remember that if you add water in between, the oil will not
release from the fish and the taste of the gravy will not be good at all.</li>

        <li>Then open the lid and you will see that some water has also been released from the
Shorshe Ilish Recipe and that too has been cooked well. At this time, you will have to give 2
green chilies for garnish. And then you will have to give a small amount of water. Since the fish
has become very soft by this time, shake the pan lightly without using a spatula and mix the
water with the fish. At this time, you can also sprinkle a little sugar on top. Then you have to
boil it for another 5 minutes with the lid on. The fish will be cooked well in a total of 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, if you open the lid, our Shorshe Ilish Recipe is completely ready.</li>
